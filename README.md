# Flight Management System 
## Description
This Flight Management System is a console application designed to manage flights, seat reservations, and passenger details. It allows users to interact with flights offered by an airline, reserve seats, display passenger details, and exit the application.

## Features
Displaying all flights: Users can view all available flights along with their details.
Reserve a seat: Users can reserve seats on a flight by providing necessary information such as flight number, number of seats to book, passenger name, age, and passport number.
Display passenger details: Users can search for passenger details using their passport number.
Error handling: The system incorporates error handling mechanisms to deal with invalid inputs, out-of-range arguments, and other potential errors.

## Usage
Compile the code with appropriate compiler settings.
Run the compiled executable.
Choose from the following options:
- Display all flights
-  Reserve a seat
-  Display passenger details
-  Exit the application

## Dependencies
The code requires the following header files: airline.h, businessflight.h, economyflight.h.
Standard C++ libraries are used (iostream, stdexcept).

### Note
Ensure proper input format is followed as per the prompts.
Passenger details are stored and retrieved using passport numbers.

### Memory Management
The code employs dynamic memory allocation for flight objects using new, and deallocates memory using delete at the end of execution.

### Error Handling
Exceptions are caught using try-catch blocks to handle potential errors during execution.
